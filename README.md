This repo contains two scripts: WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## WeatherPy
A script that creates a random list of longitudes and latitudes and uses citiPy library and openweatherAPI to request weather related information for cities close to the generated coordinates.

## VacationPy

A script that visualizes the locations and other information related to the generated list of cities and narrows down the selection based on specific criteria to select vacation ready locations.
